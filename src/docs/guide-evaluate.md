# Evaluation of Expressions

## Using Assumptions

## Evaluating the Arguments of a Function

<div class=symbols-table>

| Symbol        | Description |
| :------------ | :---------- |
| `Hold`        |             |
| `ReleaseHold` |             |
| `Evaluate`    |             |
| `Simplify`    |             |

</div>

## Simplifying

Before simplifying, the expression is reduced to a canonical form.

Note: the same basic loop is used when simplifying an expression.
