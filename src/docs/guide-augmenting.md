The [MathJSON Standard Library](/compute-engine/guides/standard-library/) is a
collection of definitions for **symbols** and **functions** such as `Pi`, `Add`,
`Sin`, `Power`, `List`, etc...

In this guide we discuss how to augment the MathJSON Standard Library with your
own definitions.

{% readmore "/compute-engine/guides/latex-syntax/#customizing-the-latex-dictionary" %}
You may also be interested in **augmenting the LaTeX dictionary** which defines
how LaTeX is parsed from and serialized to MathJSON. This is useful if you want
to add support for new LaTeX commands, or if you've defined custom LaTeX macros
that you'd like to parse to MathJSON. {% endreadmore %}

## Introduction

### Declaring an Identifier

Before it can be used, an identifier must be **declared** as a symbol or a
function.

Declaring it indicates to the Compute Engine the "kind" of object it is (a
string, a real number, a function...), and allows it to be used in expressions.
The "kind" of an object is called its **domain**.

{% readmore "/compute-engine/guides/domains" %} Learn more about **domains**.
{% endreadmore %}

**To declare an identifier** use the `ce.declare()` method:

```js
ce.declare("m_e", {
  domain: "RealNumber",
  constant: true,
  value: 9.1e-31,
});
```

After an identifier is declared, its domain cannot be changed: other expressions
may depend on it, and changing its domain would invalidate them.

You can also declare an identifier without providing a value:

```js
ce.declare("f", "Function");

// Shortcut for:
ce.declare("f", { signature: { domain: "Function" } });
```

By default, when a new identifier is encountered in an expression, it is
declared automatically with a domain of `ce.defaultDomain` and no value. To
prevent this behavior, set `ce.defaultDomain` to `null`. An error will be
produced instead when an unknown identifier is encountered.

{% readmore "/compute-engine/guides/evaluate/#default-domain" %} Read more about
the **default domain**. {% endreadmore %}

We will discuss in more details below how to declare and define symbols and
functions.

### Scope

The declaration of an identifier is done within a **scope**. A scope is a
hierarchical collection of definitions.

`ce.declare()` will add a definition in the current scope. Use `ce.pushScope()`
if you want to create a new scope.

{% readmore "/compute-engine/guides/evaluate/#scopes" %}Read more about
<strong>scopes</strong> {% endreadmore %}

### Assigning a Value

Once declared an identifier can be used in expressions, and it can be assigned a
value.

To change the value of a symbol, use the `value` property of the symbol.

```js
const n = ce.box("n");
n.value = 5;
console.log(`${n.latex} = ${n.value.json}`);
// âž” n = 5
```

Alternatively, use `ce.assign()`:

```js
ce.assign("n", 5);
```

## Defining a Symbol

A symbol is a named value, such as `Pi` or `x`.

{% readmore "/compute-engine/guides/symbols" %} Learn more about **symbols**.
{% endreadmore %}

**To declare a new symbol** use the `ce.declare()` method.

```js
ce.declare("m", { domain: "Number", value: 5 });
ce.declare("n", { domain: "Integer" });
```

The `domain` property is optional when a value is provided.

See the `SymbolDefinition` type for more details on the properties associated
with a symbol.

You can change the value of one or more symbols using `ce.assign()`.

```js
ce.assign("m", 10);
```

As a shortcut, if the symbol was not previously defined, a new definition will
be created. The domain of the symbol will be set to inferred from the value.

You can also change the value of a symbol with
`ce.box("m").value = 10`.{.--notice-info}

## Declaring a Function

A function is a named operation, such as `Add`, `Sin` or `f`.

{% readmore "/compute-engine/guides/functions" %} Learn more about
**functions**. {% endreadmore %}

Let's say you want to parse the following expression:

```js example
const expr = ce.parse("\\operatorname{double}(3)");
console.log(expr.json);
// âž” ["Multiply", "double", "3"]
```

ðŸ¤” Hmmm... That's probably not what you want.

You probably want to get `["double", 3]` instead. The problem is that the
Compute Engine doesn't know what `double` is, so it assumes it's a symbol.

You can control how unknown identifiers are handled by setting the
`ce.latexOptions.parseUnknownIdentifier` property to a function that returns
`function` if the argument string is a function, `symbol` if it's a symbol or
`unknown` otherwise. For example, you set it up so that identifiers that start
with an upper case letter are always assume to be functions, or any other
convention you want. This only affects what happens when parsing LaTeX, though,
and has no effect when using MathJSON expressions. {.notice--info}

To tell the Compute Engine that `double` is a function, you need to declare it.

**To declare a function**, use the `ce.declare()` function.

```js example
ce.declare("double", { signature: { domain: "Function" } });
```

The `signature` property defines how the function can be used. It is a
`FunctionDefinition` object with the following properties (all are optional):

- `domain`: the domain of the function. The `Function` domain represents any
  function. "NumericFunction" represents a function whose arguments are number
  and that returns a numeric value. More complex domains can be specified to
  described the domain of the arguments of the function and the domain of its
  return v
- `canonical(ce, args)` returns a canonical representation of the function. This
  is an opportunity to check that the arguments are valid, and to return a
  canonical representation of the function.
- `simplify(ce, args)` returns a simplified representation of the function. This
  is an opportunity to simplify the function, for example if the arguments are
  known to be numeric and exact.
- `evaluate(ce, args)` returns a symbolic evaluation of the function. The
  arguments may be evaluated symbolically.
- `N(ce, args)` returns a numeric evaluation of the function.

See `FunctionDefinition` for more details on these properties and others
associated with a function definition.

Now, when you parse the expression, you get the expected result:

```js example
const expr = ce.parse("\\operatorname{double}(3)");
console.log(expr.json);
// âž” ["double", 2] ðŸŽ‰
```

### Defining a Function

However, you still can't evaluate the expression, because the Compute Engine
doesn't know how to evaluate `double` yet, it just knows that `double` is a
function.

```js example
console.log(ce.evaluate(expr).json);
// âž” ["double", 3]
```

For the Compute Engine to evaluate `double`, you need to define provide a
definition for it.

```js example
ce.declare("double", {
  signature: {
    domain: "Function",
    evaluate: (ce, args) => ce.number(args[0].valueOf() * 2),
  },
});
```

By adding an `evaluate` handler to the definition of `double`, you've told the
Compute Engine how to evaluate it. The `evaluate` handler is called when the
corresponding function is evaluated. It receives two arguments:

- `ce`: the Compute Engine instance
- `args`: an array of the arguments that have been applied to the function. Each
  argument is a `MathJSON` expression. The array may be empty if there are no
  arguments.

If you evaluate the expression now, you get the expected result:

```js example
console.log(ce.evaluate(expr).json);
// âž” 6 ðŸŽ‰
```

### Changing the Definition of a Function

**To change the definition of a function**, use `ce.assign()`.

```js example
ce.assign("f", (ce, args) => ce.number(args[0].valueOf() * 5)};
```

If `"f"` was previously declared as something other than a function, a runtime
error will be thrown. The domain of a symbol cannot be changed after its
declaration.{.notice--info}

As a shortcut, if you assign a value to an identifier that was not previously
declared, a new function definition is created, if the value is a function.

The value can be a JavaScript function

```js example
ce.assign("g", (ce, args) => ce.number(args[0].valueOf() * 5)};
```

The value can be a MathJSON expression:

```js example
ce.assign("f(x)", ["Multiply", "x", 5]);
```

Note in this case we added `(x)` to the first argument of `ce.assign()` to
indicate that `f` is a function. This is equivalent to the more verbose:

```js example
ce.assign("f", ["Function", ["Multiply", "x", 5], "x"]);
```

The value can be a LaTeX expression:

```js example
ce.assign("f(x)", ce.parse("5x"));
```

Evaluating an `["Assign"]` expression is equivalent to calling `ce.assign()`:

```js example
ce.evaluate(["Assign", "f", ["Function", ["Multiply", "x", 2], "x"]]);
```

## Acting on Multiple Functions and Symbols

**To declare multiple functions and symbols**, use the `ce.declare()` method
with a dictionary of definitions.

**Note:** The keys to `ce.declare()` (`m`, `f`, etc...) are MathJSON
identifiers, not LaTeX commands. For example, if you have a symbol `Î±`, use
`alpha`, not `\alpha` {.notice--info}

```js
ce.declare({
  m: { domain: "Number", value: 5 },
  f: { domain: "Function" },
  g: { domain: "Function" },
  Smallfrac: {
    signature: {
      domain: "NumericFunction",
      evaluate: (ce, args) => ce.box(args[0].valueOf() / args[1].valueOf()),
    },
  },
});
```

**To assign multiple functions and symbols**, use the `ce.assign()` method with
a dictionary of values.

```js
ce.assign({
  "m": 10,
  "f(x)": ce.parse("2x^2 + 3x + 5"),
  "g(t)": ce.parse("t^3 + 4t + 1"),
});
```

## Summary

Before a function can be used in an expression, it must be declared. This is
done by adding a definition to the MathJSON library.

The quickest way to declare and define a function is to use `ce.assign()`:

```js example
ce.assign("f(x)", ce.parse("5x"));
```
