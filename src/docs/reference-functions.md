The standard library of the Compute Engine includes many built-in functions such
as `["Add"]`, `["Sin"]`, `["Power"]`, etc...

It is also possible to define your own functions.

## Declaring a Function

Let's say you want to parse the following expression:

```js example
const expr = ce.parse('f(2)');
console.log(expr.json);
// -> ["Multiply", "f", "2"]
```

ðŸ¤” Hmmm... That's probably not what you want. You probably want to get:

```json example
["f", 2]
```

Since originally the Compute Engine doesn't know anything about `f`, it doesn't
know that `f` is a function. It just sees a symbol `f` and a number `2`.

You can control how unknown identifiers are handled by setting the
`ce.latexOptions.parseUnknownIdentifier` property to a function that returns
`function` if the argument string is a function, `symbol` if it's a symbol or
`unknown` otherwise. {.notice--info}

To tell the Compute Engine that `f` is a function, you need to declare it.

**To declare a function**, use the `ce.let()` function.

```js example
ce.let({ f: { domain: 'Function' } });
```

Note that you can use `ce.let()` to declare multiple functions (or symbols) at
once.

Now, when you parse the expression, you get the expected result:

```js example
const expr = ce.parse('f(2)');
console.log(expr.json);
// -> ["f", 2] ðŸŽ‰
```

However, you still can't evaluate the expression, because the Compute Engine
doesn't know how to evaluate `f`, it just knows it's a function.

```js example
console.log(ce.evaluate(expr).json);
// -> ["f", 2]
```

To evaluate `f`, you need to define it.

## Defining a Function

**To define a function**, use the `ce.let()` function.

```js example
ce.let({
  f: {
    domain: 'Function',
    evaluate: (ce, args) => ce.box(args[0].N().valueOf() * 2),
  },
});
```

This time we've added an `evaluate` handler to the definition of `f`. The
`evaluate` handler is called when the function is evaluated. It receives two
arguments:

- `ce`: the Compute Engine instance
- `args`: an array of arguments. Each argument is a `MathJSON` expression.

Note there are other attributes you can set on a function definition. See
`FunctionDefinition` for more details.

If you evaluate the expression now, you get the expected result:

```js example
console.log(ce.evaluate(expr).json);
// -> 4
```

**To change the definition of a function**, use `ce.set()`.

```js example
ce.set({ f: (ce, args) => ce.box(args[0].N().valueOf() * 5) });
```

When using `ce.set()`, you can only change the implementation of a function. If
the identifier `f` was previously declared as a `Number` you cannot change its
type to a `Function`. {.notice--info}

The `ce.let()` and `ce.set()` functions will call the more primitive
`ce.defineFunction()` and `ce.defineSymbol()` functions depending on the value
of their arguments.

You can also evaluate a `["Set"]` expression to define a function.

```js example
ce.evaluate(['Set', 'f', ['Function', 'x', ['Multiply', 'x', 2]]]);
```

The value of a function can be either a JavaScript function, as in the examples
above, or a `MathJSON` expression from LaTex:

```js example
ce.let('f(x)', ce.parse('2x'));
```

Or directly as a `MathJSON` expression:

```js example
ce.let('f(x)', ['Multiply', 'x', 2]);
```

This is equivalent to the more verbose:

```js example
ce.let('f', ['Function', ['Multiply', 'x', 2], 'x']);
```

You can also use anonymous parameters as a shorcut:

```js example
ce.let('f', ['Multiply', '_', 2]);
```

## Anonymous Functions and Anonymous Parameters

A function that is not bound to an identifier is called an **anonymous
function**. Anonymous functions are frequently used as arguments to other
functions.

In the example below, the `["Function"]` expression is an anonymous function
that is passed as an argument to the `["Sum"]` function.

```json example
["Sum", ["Function", ["Multiply", "x", 2], "x"]]
```

The parameters of a function can also be anonymous. In this case, the arguments
are bound to the wildcards `_`, `_1`, `_2`, etc... in the body of the function.
The wildcard `_` is a shorthand for `_1`, the first parameter.

In the example below, both the function and its parameters are anonymous.

```json example
["Sum", ["Multiply", "_", 2]]
```

## Evaluating an Anonymous Function

To apply a function to some arguments, use an `["Apply"]` expression.

```json example
["Apply", ["Add", 2, "_"], 4]
// âž” 6
["Apply", "Power", 2, 3]
// âž” 8
```

## Operating on Functions

{% defs "Function" "Description" %}

{% def "Function" %}

[&quot;**Function**&quot;, _body_]{.signature}

[&quot;**Function**&quot;, _body_, _arg-1_, _arg-2_, ...]{.signature}

Create an
[anonymous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function), also
called **lambda expression**.

The `arg-n` arguments are identifiers of the bound variables (parameters) of the
anonymous function.

All the arguments have the `Hold` attribute set, so they are not evaluated when
the function is created.{.notice--info}

The _body_ is a `MathJSON` expression that is evaluated when the function is
applied to some arguments.

**To apply some arguments to a function expression**, use `["Apply"]`.

{% enddef %}

{% def "Apply" %}

[&quot;**Apply**&quot;, _function_, _expr-1_, ..._expr-n_]{.signature}

[Apply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apply) a list of arguments to a function.
The _function_ is either an identifier of a function, or a `["Function"]`
expression.

The following wildcards in _body_ are replaced as indicated

- `\_` or `\_1` : the first argument
- `\_2` : the second argument
- `\_3` : the third argument, etc...
- `\_`: the sequence of arguments, so `["Length", "&#95;"]` is the number of
  arguments

If _body_ is a `["Function"]` expression, the named arguments of `["Function"]`
are replaced by the wildcards.

```json example
["Apply", ["Multiply", "\_", "\_"], 3]
// âž” 9
["Apply", ["Function", "x", ["Multiply", "x", "x"]], 3]
// âž” 9
```

{% enddef %}

{% def "Return" %}

[&quot;**Return**&quot;, _value_]{.signature}

If in a `["Function"]` expression, interupts the evaluation of the function. The
value of the `["Function"]` expression is _value_

The `["Return"]` expression is useful when used with more complex functions that
have multiple exit points, conditional logic, loops, etc...
