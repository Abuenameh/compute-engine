# Symbolic Computing

The CortexJS Compute Engine essentially applies transformations to a MathJSON
expression that results in another MathJSON expression.

There are several ways to apply transformations, depending on the desired
result:

- Format
- Simplify
- Evaluate
- Compare, find patterns and substitute


The `evaluate()` function is a convenient shorthand to evaluate an expression
with a single call. Other functions such as `ce.simplify()`, `ce.is()`, `ce.N()`, `ce.canonical()`, etc... require a `ComputeEngine` instance which is denoted by the `ce.` prefix.{.notice--info}

```ts
import { ComputeEngine, parse } from 'compute-engine';
const ce = new ComputeEngine();
ce.simplify(parse('3x^2 + 2x^2 + x + 5'));
```

## Format with a Canonical Form

The canonical form of an expression is obtained by rewriting an expression
without making assumptions about any variables in the expression.

For example:

- terms can be sorted in a specific order
- some operations may be substituted with others, for example
  substraction replaced by addition. \\(1 + 2 - 3 \longrightarrow Add(1, 2,
  -3)\\)

Canonical forms are somewhat arbitrary, and not necessarily "the simplest" way
to represent an expression. But just like the order of the letters of the
alphabet is arbitrary, the canonical forms are nonetheless convenient to sort,
search and compare expressions.

For example \\( 1 + x\\) and \\(x + 1\\) are two expressions with the same canonical form.


**To obtain the canonical form of an expression**, use the `ce.canonical()` function.

```js
console.log(ce.canonical(["Add", 2, "x", 3]);
// âž” ["Add", 2, 3, "x"]
```

## Simplify

**To obtain a simpler expression of a symbolic expression**, use the
`ce.simplify()` function.

Assumptions are additional information available about some symbols, for example
\\( x > 0 \\) or \\(n \in \\N\\). To apply some transformations, available
assumptions may be used. For example, if no assumptions about \\(x \\) is
available the expression \\( \sqrt{x^2} \\) cannot be simplified. However, if an
assumption that \\( x > 0 \\) is available, then the expression can be
simplified to \\( x \\).

Read more about [Assumptions](/guides/compute-engine/assumptions).{.notice--info}


## Evaluate

**To combine a symbolic simplification followed by a [numerical evaluation](/guides/compute-engine/numerical-evaluation)**, use
the `ce.evaluate()` function.

Invoking the `ce.evaluate()` function is roughly equivalent to calling in sequence
`ce.simplify()`, `ce.N()` then `ce.canonical()`.

Some functions may perform additional computations when `ce.evaluate()` is 
invoked.

## Other Symbolic Manipulation

You can compare two expressions, check if an expression match a pattern or 
apply a substitution to some elements in an expression.

Learn more about using [Patterns](guides/compute-engine/patterns) for these operations.
