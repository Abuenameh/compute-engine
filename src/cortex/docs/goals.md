# Goals and Priorities

- Ergonomics: code that is easy to read, understand and write
- Familiarity: whenever a concept or notation is broadly in use from the world
  of programming languages or scientific notation, they should be reused if
  applicable.
- Approachability. Simple things should be easy to do, complex things should
  be possible.
- Expressiveness. The solution of a problem should be expressed
  - in the closest way to the original problem formulation
  - in a clear, natural, consice and intuitive way
- Error Recovery: whenever an unexpected result is reached, it should be 
  easy to understand what caused it, and how to recover from it.

## Non-Goals

- Migration from existing programming languages
