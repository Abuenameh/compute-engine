  `\begin{pmatrix}...\end{pmatrix}`
- Correctly parse LaTeX groups, i.e. `{...}`
- Ensure constructible trigonometric values are canonical
- Correct and simplify evaluation loop for `simplify()`, `evaluate()` and `N()`.
- **#41** Preserve the parsed LaTeX verbatim for top-level expressions
- **#40** Correctly calculate the synthetic LaTeX metadata for numbers
- Only require Node LTS (16.14.2)

## 0.4.4

**Release Date**: 2022-03-27

### Improvements

- Added option to specify custom LaTeX dictionaries in `ComputeEngine`
  constructor
- `expr.valueOf` returns rational numbers as `[number, number]` when applicable
- The non-ESM builds (`compute-engine.min.js`) now targets vintage JavaScript
  for improved compatibility with outdated toolchains (e.g. Webpack 4) and
  environments. The ESM build (`compute-engine.min.esm.js`) targets evergreen
  JavaScript (currently ECMAScript 2020).

## 0.4.3

**Release Date**: 2022-03-21

### Transition Guide from 0.4.2

The API has changed substantially between 0.4.2 and 0.4.3, however adapting code
to the new API is very straightforward.

The two major changes are the introduction of the `BoxedExpression` class and
the removal of top level functions.

### Boxed Expression

The `BoxedExpression` class is a immutable box (wrapper) that encapsulates a
MathJSON `Expression`. It provides some member functions that can be used to
manipulate the expression, for example `expr.simplify()` or `expr.evaluate()`.

The boxed expresson itself is immutable. For example, calling `expr.simplify()`
will return a new, simplfied, expression, without modifying `expr`.

To create a "boxed" expression from a "raw" MathJSON expression, use `ce.box()`.
To create a boxed expression from a LaTeX string, use `ce.parse()`.

To access the "raw" MathJSON expression, use the `expr.json` property. To
serialize the expression to LaTeX, use the `expr.latex` property.

The top level functions such as `parse()` and `evaluate()` are now member
functions of the `ComputeEngine` class or the `BoxedExpression` class.

There are additional member functions to examine the content of a boxed
expression. For example, `expr.symbol` will return `null` if the expression is
not a MathJSON symbol, otherwise it will return the name of the symbol as a
string. Similarly, `expr.ops` return the arguments (operands) of a function,
`expr.asFloat` return `null` if the expression does not have a numeric value
that can be represented by a float, a `number` otherwise, etc...

### Canonical Form

Use `expr.canonical` to obtain the canonical form of an expression rather than
the `ce.format()` method.

The canonical form is less aggressive in its attempt to simplify than what was
performed by `ce.format()`.

The canonical form still accounts for distributive and associative functions,
and will collapse some integer constants. However, in some cases it may be
necessary to invoke `expr.simplify()` in order to get the same results as
`ce.format(expr)`.

### Rational and Division

In addition to machine floating points, arbitrarily long decimal numbers and
complex number, the Compute Engine now also recognize and process rational
numbers.

This is mostly an implementation detail, although you may see
`["Rational", 3, 4]`, for example, in the value of a `expr.json` property.

If you do not want rational numbers represented in the value of the `.json`
property, you can exclude the `Rational` function from the serialization of JSON
(see below) in which case `Divide` will be used instead.

Note also that internally (as a result of boxing), `Divide` is represented as a
product of a power with a negative exponent. This makes some pattern detection
and simplifications easier. However, when the `.json` property is accessed,
product of powers with a negative exponents are converted to a `Divide`, unless
you have included `Divide` as an excluded function for serialization.

Similarly, `Subtract` is converted internally to `Add`, but may be serialized
unless excluded.

### Parsing and Serialization Customization

Rather than using a separate instance of the `LatexSyntax` class to customize
the parsing or serialization, use a `ComputeEngine` instance and its
`ce.parse()` method and the `expr.latex` property.

Custom dictionaries (to parse/serialize custom LaTeX syntax) can be passed as an
argument to the `ComputeEngine` constructor.

For more advanced customizations, use `ce.latexOptions = {...}`. For example, to
change the formatting options of numbers, how the invisible operator is
interpreted, how unknown commands and symbols are interpreted, etc...

Note that there are also now options available for the "serialization" to
MathJSON, i.e. when the `expr.json` property is used. It is possible to control
for example if metadata should be included, if shorthand forms are allowed, or
whether some functions should be avoided (`Divide`, `Sqrt`, `Subtract`, etc...).
These options can be set using `ce.jsonSerializationOptions = {...}`.

### Comparing Expressions

There are more options to compare two expressions.

Previously, `match()` could be used to check if one expression matched another
as a pattern.

If `match()` returned `null`, the first expression could not be matched to the
second. If it returned an object literal, the two expressions matched.

The top-level `match()` function is replaced by the `expr.match()` method.
However, there are two other options that may offer better results:

- `expr.isSame(otherExpr)` return true if `expr` and `otherExpr` are
  structurally identical. Structural identity is closely related to the concept
  of pattern matching, that is `["Add", 1, "x"]` and `["Add", "x", 1]` are not
  the same, since the order of the arguments is different. It is useful for
  example to compare some input to an answer that is expected to have a specific
  form.
- `expr.isEqual(otherExpr)` return true if `expr` and `otherExpr` are
  mathematically identical. For example `ce.parse("1+1").isEqual(ce.parse("2"))`
  will return true. This is useful if the specific structure of the expression
  is not important.

It is also possible to evaluate a boolean expression with a relational operator,
such as `Equal`:

```ts
console.log(ce.box(['Equal', expr, 2]).evaluate().symbol);
// -> "True"

console.log(expr.isEqual(ce.box(2)));
// -> true
```
